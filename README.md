# CSP Solver: AC-3, Backtracking search and Min-Conflicts Implementation

A Python implementation of three popular algorithms for solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): AC-3 (Arc Consistency 3), Min-Conflicts and Backtracking search.

## Overview

This project provides:
- **`csp.py`**: Core CSP class with both AC-3 and Min-Conflicts algorithms
- **`run_algorithms/runAc3.py`**: Interactive interface for AC-3 algorithm testing
- **`run_algorithms/runMinConflicts.py`**: Combined AC-3 (optional) + Min-Conflicts solver
- **`run_algorithms/runBacktrackingSearch.py`**: Combined AC-3 (optional) + Backtracking search solver


The AC-3 algorithm enforces arc consistency by removing inconsistent values from variable domains, while Min-Conflicts uses local search to find complete solutions by iteratively fixing constraint violations.
Backtracking search performs a complete search for all the complete assignments for the CSP that satisfies all the constraints, so it finds all the possible solutions. Min-Conflicts returns the first solution that he is
able to find, while the Backtracking search algorithm explore all the possible assignments, assigning a variable for each depth level and performing constraint propagation (MAC algorithm) to reduce the branching factor. 

## Files Description

### `csp.py`
Contains the main `Csp` class that implements both:
- **AC-3 Algorithm**: Domain reduction through arc consistency
- **Min-Conflicts Algorithm**: Local search for complete solutions
- **Backtracking search Algorithm**: DFS with constraint propagation to find all the possible solutions


### `run_algorithms/runAc3.py`
Provides the `CspAc3Runner` class with an interactive interface to:
- Define variables and their domains
- Add constraints between variables
- Solve the CSP using AC-3
- Display reduced domains

### `run_algorithms/runMinConflicts.py`
Provides flexible CSP solving with two options:
1. **AC-3 + Min-Conflicts**: First runs AC-3 to reduce domains, then applies Min-Conflicts
2. **Min-Conflicts only**: Runs Min-Conflicts directly on original domains

The user can choose which approach to use at runtime. Min-Conflicts returns the first solution that is able to find.

### `run_algorithms/runMinConflicts.py`
Provides flexible CSP solving with two options:
1. **AC-3 + Backtracking search**: First runs AC-3 to reduce domains (so the branching factor), then applies Backtracking search
2. **Backtracking search only**: Runs Backtracking search directly on original domains (the solutions are the same because of MAC constraint propagation)

## Usage

### Running AC-3 Only

```bash
cd run_algorithms
python3 runAc3.py
```

This will run the AC-3 algorithm to reduce variable domains based on constraints.

### Running Min-Conflicts (with choice of approach)

```bash
cd run_algorithms
python3 runMinConflicts.py
```

When you run this, you'll be prompted to choose:
- **Option 1**: Run AC-3 first, then Min-Conflicts on reduced domains
- **Option 2**: Run Min-Conflicts directly on original domains

**Option 1** is recommended for complex CSPs as AC-3 can significantly reduce the search space.
**Option 2** follows the standard Min-Conflicts approach 


### Running Backtracking search (with choice of approach)

```bash
cd run_algorithms
python3 runBacktrackingSearch.py
```
When you run this, you'll be prompted to choose:
- **Option 1**: Run AC-3 first, then Backtracking search on reduced domains
- **Option 2**: Run Backtracking search directly on original domains

**Option 1** is recommended for complex CSPs as AC-3 can significantly reduce the branching factor.
**Option 2** it's also a valid option because Backtracking search uses MAC algorithm to perform constraint propagation, but the branching factor might be high for some CSP's

### Using Input Files

You can automate input using text files:

```bash
python3 runMinConflicts.py < input_file.txt
python3 runBacktrackingSearch.py < input_file.txt
```

Example input file format:
```
1
a,b,c,d
1,3,4
1,3,4
1,2,3
1,2,3
a!=b
b!=a
a>d
d<a
done
100000
```

The first line specifies the choice:
- `1` for AC-3 + Min-Conflicts (or Backtracking search in `run_algorithms/runBacktrackingSearch.py`)
- `2` for Min-Conflicts only (or Backtracking search only in `run_algorithms/runBacktrackingSearch.py`)

### Example Session

Here's a complete example showing the choice between approaches (running Min-Conflicts):

```
1 - run AC-3 first and then Min-Conflicts on the CSP that you will insert 
2 - run directly Min-Conflicts

## Constraint Formats

The system supports several constraint formats:

### Comparison Constraints
- **Equality**: `A=B`, `A==B`
- **Inequality**: `A!=B`, `A<>B`
- **Ordering**: `A<B`, `A>B`, `A<=B`, `A>=B`

### Absolute Value Constraints
- **Exact difference**: `|A-B|=2`
- **Minimum difference**: `|A-B|>1`
- **Maximum difference**: `|A-B|<3`
- **Range**: `|A-B|>=1`, `|A-B|<=4`

### Custom Lambda Constraints
Type `custom` to enter custom lambda functions:
```
First variable: a
Second variable: b
lambda x, y: (x + y) % 2 == 0
```

## Important Notes

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Important Notes

### Node Consistency (Preprocessing Required)
**Node consistency must be enforced manually as a preprocessing step.** Before running the algorithms, you must remove any values from variable domains that violate unary constraints (constraints involving only one variable).

Examples of unary constraints:
- `X > 5`: Remove all values â‰¤ 5 from X's domain
- `Y % 2 == 0`: Keep only even values in Y's domain
- `Z != 3`: Remove value 3 from Z's domain

**The algorithms in this project only handle binary constraints (between two variables). Unary constraints must be resolved by manually filtering domains before defining the CSP. Other types of constraint must be turned into binary ones**

### Bidirectional Constraints
**All constraints must be entered in both directions manually.** This design choice ensures explicit control over the CSP definition (AC-3 works with a directed graph representation of the CSP).

Examples:
- For `A > B`, you must enter both `A>B` AND `B<A`
- For `A = B`, you must enter both `A=B` AND `B=A`
- For `|A-B|=2`, you must enter both `|A-B|=2` AND `|B-A|=2`

### Variable Names
- Variables can be uppercase or lowercase letters (e.g., A, b)
- Multi-character variable names are supported (e.g., `var1`, `abc`)

### Domain Values
- Domains can contain integers or strings
- Values are automatically converted to integers when possible
- Mixed domains (integers and strings) are supported
